# Parallel Spectral Clustering on GPU-CPU Platforms

## Introduction
##

This software package provides a fast implementation of spectral clustering on GPU and CPU platforms. This work is published on IPDPS 2016 PCO workshop titled as "A high performance implementation of spectral clustering on cpu-gpu platforms". 

Spectral clustering is a computationally expensive . Our implementation utilizes the existing 
The implementation is primarily based on the ARPACK++ eigensolver and the k-means
